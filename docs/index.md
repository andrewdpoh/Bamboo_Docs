# Introduction

Bamboo is a Command & Control (C2) Framework that consists of three main components: Bamboo Client, Bamboo Teamserver, and Bamboo Agent. These components work together to allow users to have a seamless scalable experience to do penetration testing or general testing of evading Elastic. 
Bamboo offers multiple pre-built evasion techniques that are well tested and modified to evade Elastic. Moreover, there are multiple built-in third party exploits that users can use initially to try out Bamboo.
